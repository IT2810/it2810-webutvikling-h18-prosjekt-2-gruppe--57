  "content": "O Thou bright jewel in my aim I strive\nTo comprehend thee. Thine own words declare\nWisdom is higher than a fool can reach.\nI cease to wonder, and no more attempt\nThine height t’explore, or fathom thy profound.\nBut, O my soul, sink not into despair,\nVirtue is near thee, and with gentle hand\nWould now embrace thee, hovers o’er thine head.\nFain would the heav’n-born soul with her converse,\nThen seek, then court her for her promis’d bliss."
