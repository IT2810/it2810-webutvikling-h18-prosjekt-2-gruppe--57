     "content": "I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,\nThose of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe\nand strong,\nThe carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,\nThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off\nwork,\nThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the\ndeckhand singing on the steamboat deck,\nThe shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing\nas he stands,\nThe wood-cutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the\nmorning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,\nThe delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at\nwork, or of the girl sewing or washing,\nEach singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,\nThe day what belongs to the dayâ€”at night the party of young\nfellows, robust, friendly,\nSinging with open mouths their strong melodious songs."
